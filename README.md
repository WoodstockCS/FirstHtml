### purpose
In this assignment you will learn how to edit webpages. You will update the webpage for one of your previous assignments.
### steps
1. You do *not* need to fork this repo.
1. Log in at [khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org) (or create an account if you don't already have one!)
1. Go to the coaches tab in your profile.
1. In the `Add a coach` field, enter the class code:
   - B block: `XGMT2S`
   - H block: `8BR5J8`
1. Follow the `Hour Of Webpages` mission, which is [linked here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html). AFTER YOU CLICK THAT LINK, MAKE SURE YOU ARE STILL LOGGED IN. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LOG IN AGAIN.

Great! You have some experience editing webpages, and next you will update one of the webpages that displays a processing sketch.
1. Go to your lightning repo and put the `index.html` file in edit mode.
1. Replace the existing code with [the code here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WoodstockCS/Lightning/gh-pages/index.html), and commit the changes.
1. Put the `index.html` file back into edit mode, and make it unique by doing the following updates. View the updates on from the "github pages" link on your `Settings` page, and remember that sometimes it takes a minute for your changes to be seen on that webpage. Commit early and commit often! Your updated file must have:
   - instructions for how to interact with your lightning sketch (see the student examples on the Lightning repo)
   - unique text and background coloring
   - functioning page at github.io
   - replacements for all the REPLACE ME text 
   - add at least one new headline (other than h1)
   - at least one pair of paragraph tags
   - at least one pair of strong or em tags in the paragraph text
   - _DISTINGUISHED_:
      - some interesting facts about lightning
      - at least one pair of list tags (you choose: ordered or unordered), having at least three list items
